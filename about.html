      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm Diana (also known as Phoenix). I am a fiction writer starting a
          journey in full stack Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had always been fascinated by technology,wanting to know how it
          works and what can be created with its advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          There isn't much to say now as I am just at the beginning of it all, I
          have a good understanding of HTML/CSS, and will start learning
          JavaScript soon. I also plan on learning C# and Unity in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being neurodivergent made me curious of the unknown and gave me the
          belief that continuous learning and self-reflection is the esssence of
          not only understanding ourselves but also becoming more atuned to
          others and the world we live in.
